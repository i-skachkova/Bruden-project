            Our backpacks are not normal-sized.
            They are made in a mini size
            since this really is an
            alternative to a handbag,
            not solely in size but also
            in how you wear it.

            Two shoulder straps distribute the
            weight more evenly across the back.
            This will make women feel more comfortable
            while walking and reduces the likelihood of
            muscle spasms and poor posture

            Our number one product, Bruden's Backpack was created for
            those who need an alternative to wearing a handbag. Those who prefer to
            wear their bags on their back than on just one shoulder
